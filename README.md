# RotaMaker-4-RELEASE
!!!DISCLAIMER!!!
This project is in development/prorotype stage.

## INSTALLATION

1. Download the repo zip.
2. Inside the "Release" folder there is an "install" file that needs to be ran first before using the program. This install all the prerequisites needed for the program to run, such as Access Database Engine 2016.
3. After the terminal window has closed, you can then run the "RotaMaker 4.exe" file to start the application.
4. You can create a shortcut and move it somewhere else.

## DESCRIPTION

RotaMaker 4 helps businesses in the hospitality sector to create/share schedules and manage employee data easily and quickly, while keeping it as simple as using a spreadsheet. This tool makes it easier to transition from non-technical to technical scheduling.

This is a prototype program, so security implementation and sharing through email features are not the most reliable for use by bigger bussiness.
It has a simple layout and will run on older WINDOWS machines as well. It does not require a capable hardware to run.

## LOGIN

Loging in for the first time after installation can be done by entering "1" as both the USERNAME and PASSWORD.

## FIRST STEPS

On logging in you will be introduced to the main menu:

![image](https://github.com/dannkis/RotaMaker-4-RELEASE/assets/62340093/8dd45a78-206c-4eb5-a56c-1385a25ad770)

There is some information left in the DATABASE, which was used for testing purposes but also left for the user to play around with the application before final use, so the user can familiarise themselves with the program.

I would HIGHLY suggest DELETING ALL of the existing data before using the program.

### USERS

On clicking the "Users" tab inside the main menu you will be greeted by this or a similar to this screen:

![image](https://github.com/dannkis/RotaMaker-4-RELEASE/assets/62340093/dd705c71-0154-433a-b3a3-87816ef2e5b1)

This is where you can ADD, EDIT, and DELETE users. Users are the ones that can ACCESS the program. You can also manage the amount of access that a USER can have when using the program (LIMITING THEM TO ONLY USERS SECTION OR STAFF). Of course a USER can have access to both if needed.

**ADDING A NEW USER**

It is a REQUIREMENT that a USER is also a STAFF MEMBER! Each USER account is associate with a STAFF MEMBER entry of the program. A STAFF MEMBER can be associated to MULTIPLE USER ACCOUNTS. On clicking the "Add New User" tab, you can ADD a new user by selecting a matching staff member entry, setting a USERNAME and PASSWORD, and setting their access to the different sections of the program. For security purposes a username needs to be between 4 and 26 characters long. A password needs to be between 8 and 26 characters long.

**EDITING AN EXISTING USER**

Editing an existing USER happens by selecting a user from the table, and then clicking on the "Edit" tab.

After this you can EDIT all the information about the user, aside from CHANGING the staff member that the selected user is associated to.

**DELETING A USER**

Similarly to EDITING a USER, you firstly have to select a USER from the table, after which you click on the DELETE tab on the side. Be aware that DELETING is IMMEDIATE, so after a user is DELETED, it cannot be retrieved, so be carefull. You cannot DELETE the USER that is CURRENTLY logged in.

### Staff

The STAFF tab from the MAIN MENU is where you can ADD, EDIT, and DELETE STAFF MEMBERS. The layout and the functionality is the same as in the USERS tab, with the difference being that the information required for ADDING a user is different.

![image](https://github.com/dannkis/RotaMaker-4-RELEASE/assets/62340093/526ec61e-a0cf-412d-99f2-8db91ba48c5b)

**ADDING A NEW STAFF MEMBER**

The requirements for adding a new STAFF MEMBER are that all the boxes need to be filled in and there needs to be a VALID email address, to avoid problems when sending an email through the program. If you are not UK based, in the box where it says "NINO" any value can be entered.

**EDITING AND DELETING**

This is the same procedure as EDITING and DELETING a USER, so for more detailed information, check above.

### ROTA

Here you can SEND, UPDATE, PRINT and DELETE data from the scheduling table.

**ADDING/EDITING SHIFTS**

This is a very straightforward task. You can see that under the table, there are boxes that can be filled in, modified, and checked off as needed to reflect the status of the shifts for certain day. On entering a new shift you can see that the TOTAL amount of hors are calculated automatically. In this section you can also see how long a SHIFT is in terms of HH:MM, as well as how many HOLIDAYS have been taken, if any.

If you want to ADD a new SHIFT, you simply click the DROPDOWN MENU on the upper left corner, where you can select a new STAFF MEMBER. Editing existing entries in the table can be done either by SELECTING them from the table, or by the DROPDOWN MENU. 

![image](https://github.com/dannkis/RotaMaker-4-RELEASE/assets/62340093/100faff2-4f3a-41ec-b806-a49035267841)

After changing the SHIFTS accordingly, click on the "Update Table" tab on the left to add the new entry.

DELETING shifts is the same as DELETING USERS and STAFF MEMBERS, you click on the the row you want to DELETE, and click the "Delete" tab on the left.

**SENDING ROTA THROUGH EMAIL**

This can be done by clicking the "Send Email" tab on the left. Here you can choose WHO to send the rota to (EVERYONE OR STAFF FROM ROTA). You need to input both your EMAIL and YOUR PASSWORD. Your PASSWORD will NOT BE SAVED for security purposes.

!!!DISCLAIMER!!!

This program is still in development/a prototype. Although it is in FINAL state and there may not be any updates, in order to send an email you are required to use a GMAIL account that has the "Less Secure Apps" permission turned on beforehand. This is due to licensing policy as this app is not officially published yet. I strongly suggest creating an email with the "Less Secure Apps" permission turned on only for sending emails, rather than using you PERSONAL email!

**PRINTING THE TABLE**

On clicking the "Print" tab on the left side, the Windows's PRINTING PREVIEW WINDOW will show up, where you can CHOOSE a printer and change PRINTING SETTINGS. After this you will get a PRINT PREVIEW that will look something like this:

Here you can further change the document, after which you click on PRINTER ICON on the upper left side of the windows:
